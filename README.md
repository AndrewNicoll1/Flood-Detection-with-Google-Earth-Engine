# Flood-Detection-with-Google-Earth-Engine
A machine learning oriented approach to global flood mapping using Sentinel satellite imagery. Geospatial data is retrieved from Google Earth Engine API and corresponding image metadata is stored in CSV files. 'UK Flood Detection' contains original code I developed to classify and store pre-flood and inflood images using time-series thresholding on the NDWI index. 'Flood Detection and Classification' implements the former code to provide a training set for a machine learning model (a random forest ensemble). I set out optional pre-processing procedures on SAR and optical images for maximum accuracy in water pixel classification.
